## Objective of the Sessions

### I. Data Anonymization
*   Code Satisfiability of Anonymity Criteria (K-Anonymity, L-Diversity, T-Closeness).
*   Implement Perturbative & Non-Perturbative Methods for satisfying Anonymity Criteria.
*   Understand Trade-Offs in Anonymization and Limitations of different Anonymity Criteria.

### II. Algorithmic Fairness: Regression

*   Understand Bias Propagation in Regression as a consequence of Omitting Sensitive Variables.
*   Implement Fairness Criteria for Regression (Counterfactual Fairness & Demographic Parity).
*   Work through Case Studies to adapt Fairness Criteria to real-world scenarios.

### III. Algorithmic Fairness: Classification
